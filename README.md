# UrgentEnquiryButton
Urgent Enquiry button, stays on top
- The button is visible on all pages, and stays on top.
- It shall lead to a form that prompts User to enter their Email ID and Phone No. and fill in a human verification captcha.
- The form it leads to shall be made with Contact Form 7 (We are currently using CF7 for all our contact forms) and the popup shall be made with PopupMaker.
- Temporarily removed since it is being overlapped by the "scroll to top" button and we're yet to decide the positions for both the buttons to have them co-exist safely.
